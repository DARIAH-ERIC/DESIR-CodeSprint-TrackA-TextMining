For semigroups with 0 the proofs are analogous to those for associative rings. Finally, the equivalence of (I), (IV) and (V) has been established in this paper. ADDED IN PROOF.

Can the third sector release the imagination and the vision to which governments, or their current advisers, seem blind? Can the Dome become an icon of what we can, in the new century, leave behind? Meanwhile, William Gibson's bridge, discussed below by Richard Skeates, and the now demolished Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong, present images for the liberated zones, related movements and sympathetic governments-local, regional and national -of the future."

Ornstein'sd-distance  [18] ,  [13]  is also a meaningful distance when the uncertainty is in the input distribution, but requires the cost function to be specific. Such problems for the specific case of minimum mean square estimation were considered in  [25] . The important general problem merits further research."

    "text": "A100) to the three aforementioned heterodontosaurids (Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus) and 37 other ornithischian ingroups in an analysis of 221 characters. Reanalysis of 218 of these characters (3 are uninformative) confirms their result; heterodontosaurids join a basal polytomy at the base of Ornithischia in a strict consensus of the many minimum length trees. Resolution of heterodontosaurid monophyly or relationships among heterodontosaurids was possible only when Echinodon, Lycorhinus and three other poorly known ornithischians (Zephyrosaurus, Talenkauen,  Yandusaurus)  were removed from the analysis  (Fig. 103C ). With these poorly known taxa removed, there are 27 minimum length trees (468 steps) with heterodontosaurid interrelationships resembling that in  Sereno (1986) : \"BMNH A100\" is more closely related to Heterodontosaurus than Abrictosaurus (Butler et al. 2007: fig. 4, node 4;  Fig.  103C ). In  Sereno (1986)  and the present study, \"BMNH A100\" is referred to Lycorhinus angustidens, and so the proposed relationships are the same  (Figs 102, 103C) . Pisanosaurus was positioned outside all other ornithischians. The link between \"BMNH A100\" and Heterodontosaurus, however, is supported by two synapomorphies that have broader distribution among heterodontosaurids. Increase in size of distal premaxillary teeth (Butler et al. 2008: character 114), is present to some degree in both Echinodon  (Fig. 19B)  and Abrictosaurus (Figs 31, 35). \"Heterodont dentary dentition\" : character 124) is a poorly constructed character that refers in part to the presence of a dentary caniniform tooth in \"BMNH A100\" and Heterodontosaurus. Echinodon, Lycorhinus and Abrictosaurus were scored as lacking such \"heterodonty\", although from the information in this study it is clear that Echinodon (Figs 16B, C, 19B)  and Lycorhinus angustidens  (Fig. 3)  clearly have a dentary caniniform tooth and the corresponding dentary crown in Abrictosaurus  (Figs 31, 32)  is not truly primitive in form (i.e., labiolingually compressed, subtriangular).  Zheng et al. (2009)  added Tianyulong to the dataset in , which added one more genus to the heterodontosaurid polytomy. Norman et al. (2011: 59)   also used the dataset in , restricting their reanalysis to \"diagnosable heterodontosaurids\" and a total of 14 ingroups. Thus they excluded Fruitadens, Lycorhinus, and Tianyulong, leaving three heterodontosaurids in the analysis (Abrictosaurus, \"BMNH A100\", Heterodontosaurus). Like previous hypotheses  (Sereno 1986; , their resolution positioned \"BMNH A100\" closer to Heterodontosaurus than Abrictosaurus  (Norman et al. 2011:    fig. 41 ;  Fig. 103E ) on the basis of the weak evidence cited above.  Butler et al. (2010)  added six characters (for a total of 227) and two heterodontosaurids (Tianyulong, Fruitadens) to the previous dataset . They corrected character state scores for Echinodon and ordered a subset of the multistate characters (112, 135, 137, 138, 174). Their reanalysis yielded an unresolved basal"

    "text": "Author disclosures are available with the text of this letter at www.atsjournals.org. consider. We reported no difference in daily fluid balance in the phase 2 BALTI-1 paper (7) but have no additional unpublished data from BALTI-2 (6) or BALTI-prevention (1) to help shed light on this action. However, we note that when intravenous b 2 -adrenergic agonists were used for tocolysis during pregnancy, they have been associated with reduced sodium, potassium, and water excretion, leading to a reduced hematocrit and intravascular hypervolemia  (8, 9)  and development of maternal pulmonary edema  (10) . Finally, we suggest that, although our BALTI-prevention trial did not reduce the incidence of ARDS, we did demonstrate some findings worthy of future study. We found that inhaled salmeterol resulted in a reduction in systemic inflammation, which resulted in reduced alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction perioperatively. The magnitude of the effects was not sufficient to prevent postoperative ARDS but did significantly reduce the incidence of reported postoperative pneumonia We suggest, therefore, that salmeterol protected the alveolar epithelium in patients undergoing esophagectomy by reducing inflammatory and epithelial damage during injurious one-lung ventilation. We agree with Snyder and Johnson that combination therapies, targeting different mechanisms implicated in the development of ARDS, are likely to be needed to successfully treat and prevent ARDS. n"

    "text": "Step 6: Identification of the locus It is now a simple matter of verification that the conic Z with equation (12) passes through 1(0), I\\, h, h an d, like any conic passing through the points of an orthocentric set, is a rectangular hyperbola. This may also be deduced from equation  (12) , by applying the test for a rectangular hyperbola on a conic in areal coordinates, as given, for example in Sommerville  [3] . The polar of X (^7 , j4^, jfj) with respect to E is x + y + z = 0, the line at infinity. X is therefore the centre of \u00a3. Since there are no terms in yz, zx, xy in equation  (12) , it follows that the triangle of reference is self-polar with respect \u00a3 and hence the circumcircle of ABC passes through X. This circumcircle is also orthogonal to the director circle of \u00a3 (Gaskin's theorem). Again I am grateful to the referee for pointing out these last two properties."

Nevertheless, as argued in this paper, there are a number of issues associated with the use of this technology of which researchers themselves and those responsible for the encouragement and management of research should be aware. There is currently a great deal of interest, at both a theoretical and a practical Ievel, in the use of the Internet for teaching and leaming. However there is also a strong sense in which the research enterprise underpins the whole notion of a university, whether virtual or otherwise. This aspect should not be neglected in our consideration of the impact of computing and communications technology on tertiary institutions. 8."

Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate and reliable tracking results than Liang's algorithm  [6] , and Collins and Liu's algorithm  [5] . Future research issues include the development and implementation of a fast learning algorithm to reduce the processing time for online tracking."

Because of increased abdominal pressure, CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are falsely elevated and do not show true cardiac preload. The main limitations of OP-CABG are incomplete revascularization and intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Therefore, we suspected intraoperative surgical bleeding and right heart failure but did not consider ACS. We emphasize that all anesthesiologists and surgeons must be aware of ACS during OP-CABG, as this could be a potential complication leading to significant hemodynamic deterioration if not recognized."

The eclectic list of 'inspirators' listed leading German Faithlers and Asatruers Ludwig Fahrenkrog, Sveinbj\u00f6rn Beinteinsson, and G\u00e9za von Nem\u00e9nyi, together with Heimatschutz protagonist Paul SchultzeNaumburg, eco-anarchists Gustav Landauer and Paul Robien, and New Right theoreticians Alain de Benoist and Henning Eichberg. The fact that this webpage also provided a copy of the eco-terrorist Unabomber Manifesto points to the apocalyptic dimension of Kramps' philosophy as well as to his openness to violence in furthering bio-regionalist aims. As is the case with the American journal Tyr, in German Asatru contexts, bio-regionalism is most enthusiastically promoted by the circle around Tyr's German equivalent, the Heidnisches Jahrbuch. Both of its editors, Holger Kliemannel and Daniel Junker, have long been promoting bio-regionalist ideals. Further, Kliemannel collaborated with Kramps on an alternative Pagan journal, Stachelbeere (Gooseberry), for a number of years. However, such engagements have brought to light underlying ideological differences within this network of Neopagan bio-regionalism as well. The anti-racist Neopagan network Der Steinkreis stopped distributing Die Stachelbeere once the ethno-pluralist predilections of Kramps were revealed. Furthermore, allegations of Kramps' \"eco-fascism\" contributed to the demise of his Arbeitskreis Bioregionalismus.  116  Aside from bio-regionalism, 'geomancy,' another related blend of Heimatschutz and v\u00f6lkisch racial esotericist ecologism, has caught the attention of Asatru circles gathering around the journals Tyr and Heidnisches Jahrbuch as well as the Scandinavian online journal Kulturorgan Skadinaujo.  117  In Germany,"

    "text": "Here we show that stellar elemental abundance patterns for n-capture elements give us a deep insight into the star formation histories for nearby galaxies and \u03c9 Cen. Our finding is brought by two characteristics of n-capture elements; (a) the correlation of [r-process/Fe] with [Fe/H] in stellar abundances has a quite unique feature as seen in the Galactic halo stars, and (b) two distinct types of n-capture processes, i.e. r-and s-processes, occur in a different site, which yields the time difference in the contribution to the enrichment in the ISM between two processes. In addition, the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio which should represent the SN II/SN Ia ratio and thus serve as a nucleosynthesis clock as well as the s-/r-process elemental ratio is another powerful tool to infer the star formation history, though this might not be the case for dSph galaxies."

    "title": "Neoclassical economics: science or neoliberal ideology?",
    "text": "In this paper, we have critically examined two key theories at the heart of neoclassical economics. We have identified their fundamental conceptual weaknesses and their failure in practice in the domain of public policy. We have questioned why these theories have survived, despite their conceptual weaknesses and lack of empirical validation. Our answer is that both theories have been allied to and promoted by neoliberal ideology and, in the case of GET, by the fact that there is nothing else to hold the neoclassical economic paradigm together. So, we argue, the time has come to publicly acknowledge the weaknesses of current market theories and, indeed, to recognise that they do not satisfy scientific criteria. This, in turn, provides a strong signal to neoliberal ideology that its prescriptions for public policy are not based upon sound intellectual foundations. The crisis of 2007-2008 provides a unique opportunity to re-evaluate our core theories and beliefs, and to initiate a new research agenda free of the constraints of unsatisfactory concepts such as equilibrium and market efficiency. We are, of course, not the first to call for a change in the paradigm of economics. Many authors, both before and after the crisis, have pointed to the fundamental problems of neoclassical economics and the failure of theory to represent the real world. We add our modest contribution to this line of heterodox literature. The challenge of replacing the existing paradigm is great, and can only be achieved by a persistent collective endeavour among those who do not share the assumptions and conclusions of neoclassical theory."

Carter (Journal,  August 7, p. 361)  asks what is the medical profession's opinion of the new craze for filling children's mouths with plates and plastic or metal contraptions in order to straighten teeth or alter the shape of the jaw. Might I as a member of the medical profession with a dental qualification be permitted to comment on her letter ? I say \" comment \" advisedly, as I fear she does not seek opinion but merely desires medical support to her preformed opinion so that she can thrust it down the throats of my dental colleagues. Orthodontics is no new craze. Dr. Angle, a great figure in this science like his early English colleague, Dr. Coffin, has long since departed from the scene. This work is undertaken, broadly speaking, for three reasons-namely, to improve appearance, to improve function, and to prevent the development of psychological ills. I regret that the former is-in parents' minds at least-paramount. I am sure no informed'person can fail to place this need before verse-speaking or drama. Having established, I hope beyon'd any measure of doubt, its necessity in certain cases, a word as to frequency is in order. In the past, in this country, orthodontics has been a luxury due to its cost. However, the use of stainless steel in lieu of gold, and the introduction of the National Health Service has removed to some extent the economic restriction on its universal application. However, I feel sure that"

    "text": "The statistical accuracy that can be obtained by integrating the same luminosity on target of the 2010 run is given in  Fig. 7 , which shows both the values of transversity (open points) extracted from the existing p and d data, and the corresponding error bars (closed points) estimated using the existing p data and the d data, with the projected errors of the new measurement. The gain in precision for the d-quark ranges from a factor of 2 at small x to a factor of 5 at large x, and is also important for the u-quark. If this proposal will be approved, as we hope, by CERN, the new data will provide large Q 2 results in the x-range covered by JLab12, which is very important to evaluate the size of the Q 2 evolution, and will provide lower-x data (down to x = 0.003) which are essential both to perform the integrals necessary to evaluate the tensor charges and to estimate the TMD PDFs of the sea quarks. The data will moreover remain unique until the planned Electron Ion Collider (EIC)  [38]  will be on the floor."

    "text": "Statistically significant data derived from the RPPA analysis was visualized for network linkages as previously described.  27  Briefly, the \"Pathways in Human Cancer\" diagram (reproduced courtesy of Cell Signaling, Inc., www. cellsignal.com) along with the Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) (http://code.google.com/apis/maps) was used to create a dynamic web application called CScape (Cancer Landscape) for visualizing and navigating through the RPPA-generated data. Protein network analysis was also conducted using the statistically significant proteins from the RPPA analysis [Pathway Studio v.11.0 (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands)]. The software contains the ResNet Mammal v. 11.0 database with functional relationships and pathways of human, mouse and rat genes derived from over 24,000,000 PubMed abstracts and over 3500000 papers from Elsevier and 3rd party groups. The list of significant proteins and phosphoproteins was first mapped to the Huge Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)-approved gene symbols, which were inputted into the software. For significant proteins and phosphoproteins within each time point, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis based on the Fisher's exact test and a p value cut off of 0.05. We then generated interaction networks to determine the direct interactions between the significant proteins/phosphoproteins. Each interaction in the network is supported by at least one published reference from the ResNet Mammal v.11.0 database.  Figure 2  shows one of these networks used to visualize the RPPA data from human skin biopsies obtained 24 h post-SSL. Statistical analysis found a series of SSL-induced phosphoprotein and protein activation/expression changes that occurred at 24 h. The results showed significant activation of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ALK, VEGFR) along with downstream COX2 signaling, mitogenic (MEK-ERK pathway), pro-survival (AKT-mTOR pathway) and apoptosis pathways  (Fig. 2)"

    "text": "The Constituency project is not peculiar to Nigeria. There are similar mechanisms in other developing Countries. In Kenya, for instance the constituency development fund has been institutionalized in Kenya, Uganda, India and Tanzania. Instead of vilifying the National Assembly on the Constituency project, people should advocate for an institutional framework for the implementation of the Constituency projects as it is the case in Kenya. Also, there is need for Constituency needs assessment prior to awarding contracts. Constituency ought to get what they need and not what the representative wants or what a few influential constituents request. Since these projects are intended to alleviate poverty, provide and/ or improve on already existing infrastructure, therefore, provision of these facilities and relief packages should sincerely serve its purpose unselfishly."

I thank Glenn and Carol Lewis for offering their land as an easement to Little Singletary Lake; they were very gracious, and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Glenn's stories of Native American artifacts, lake history, black bears, and wildfires. Dr. Clemuel Johnson graciously gave permission to survey Bakers Lake Natural Area and I am very thankful for his generosity. Stephen Clark, son-in-law of Dr. Clemuel Johnson, also provided valuable information regarding wildlife use of Bakers Lake and surrounding natural areas. \"Chick\" Gaddy provided valuable information concerning Carolina bays and associated South Carolina natural community types. Mr. Gaddy's enthusiastic disposition and knowledge of South Carolina ecosystems was very beneficial to this study and I am truly grateful for his time.

The first reference to the Tomato in an American Seed Catalogue is found in Landreths' Catalogue of 1820, and the sort then referred to was a yellow Tomato.

    "text": "Objectives: Disparities of minor Histocompatibility antigens (mHA) have been considered as an important immunogenetic factor infl uencing immune responses following transplantation from unrelated donors. The aim of our study was to answer whether immunogenic mHA incompatibility in either Host-versus-Graft or Graft-versus-Host direction is present and thus may infl uence the outcome of allo-HCT from HLA-matched siblings and syngeneic twins. Methods: We have analyzed 23 patients (pts) with AML transplanted from HLA (A,B,C,DRB1,DQB1) matched siblings and 3 pts transplanted from syngeneic twins in the Dept. of Hematology and BMT, Katowice, Poland. Preparative regimen was Bu+Cy or Treosulfan+Fludarabine. Alleles encoding 11 minor Histocompatibility Antigens (mHA: HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1, ACC-1, ACC-2, HwA-9, HwA-10, UGT2B17, HY) were analyzed for each donor-recipient pair with use of Dynal AllSet mHA typing kit and PCR-SSP method. Only immunogenic mHA mismatches were considered. Information on whether mHA mismatches might result in Host-versus-Graft or Graftversus-Host responses were established with use of the minor Histocompatibility Knowledge Database of Leiden University Medical Center."

    "title": "Controls on Sensitive Research\u2014Their Evolution",
    "text": "In an article on controlling access to unclassified research (to be published in the summer 1986 issue of Library Trends) Stephen Gould of AAAS notes that the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the State Department, is now among the few national security regulations which do not explicitly exempt fundamental research from export controls. Since ITAR implements provisions in the Arms Export Control Act, Gould says this Act \"could be considered one of the 'applicable U.S. statutes' available |by which the government might] restrict unclassified technical data arising from such research.\" And while William Carey of the AAAS applauds the qualified exemption for fundamental research from tight export controls, he -as have the heads of many other research societies-castigates the attempt by DOD to begin excluding access to some unclassified fundamental research based on nationality. Technical societies may be increasingly pressured by the U.S. government to prevent their foreign members from attending sessions on applied research. The effect, Carey says, \"is to make it difficult for the scientific societies to schedule presentations representing leadingedge but unclassified work in applied and exploratory fields. And I cannot think of a faster route to mediocrity for American science and technology.\""

This book is intended to introduce the resident or student to electrocardiography. It is a well thought out and well planned book which gives a great number of patterns on which to base diagnosis without going into the electrophysiology at all. This is a considerable defect since the reader is not allowed to deduce the pathological events from the physiological ones.

Added in Proof. We understand that our lambda method is already known to conjurors as 'Kruskal's principle' (see Scientific American, February 1978). We doubt if they use a more sophisticated version, with two herds of kangaroos each confined to a residue class, with which we have obtained the factorization: 272 -3 = 83 x 131 x 294971519 x 1472414939."

    "text": "We demonstrated that the GoLF is suitable for the implementation of multiclass boosting. The significance of this result is that boosting is a state-of-the-art machine learning technique from the point of view of the quality of the learned models, which is now available in the P2P system model with fully distributed data. To achieve this, we proposed a modification of FilterBoost that allows it to learn multi-class models in a purely online fashion, and we proved theoretically that the resulting algorithm optimizes a suitably defined negative log likelihood measure. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the method. We also identified the lack of model diversity as a potential problem with GoLF. We provided a solution that was demonstrated to be effective in preserving the difference between the best model and the average models; this allowed us to propose spreading the best model as a way to benefit from the large number of models in the network."

Using the National Inpatient Sample, the investigators estimated age-standardized rates of HF hospitalization by sex and race/ethnicity between 2002 and 2013. Overall age-standardized HF hospitalization rates have declined by 30% in this time frame. However, black men and women have significantly greater burden of HF hospitalizations compared with white men and women. The authors suggest a need for a factor analysis, leading to greater improvements in HF hospitalization rates among Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders compared with white men and women."

    "text": "Acknowledgments We would like to acknowledge and thank two important individuals who have been essential in bringing this issue to reality. First, Larry Nichols, editor of The American Sociologist, has been supportive and helpful from the time that we brought the idea to him-which was a response to his own call for a special issue on RSAs. We thank him for supporting our extended vision for an issue on the PSA-and for diligently carrying out all of the crucial tasks -small and large -that are essential to a collection such as this. Second, we would like to acknowledge and thank Dean Dorn. Without Dean, this issue would never have been undertaken-because, in all likelihood, the PSA would not be worthy of such extensive consideration. All of us in the Pacific Region owe Dean a tremendous debt of gratitude for what he has done over the past quarter century to enliven our profession and careers. For some, that debt is more direct than others. Our work on this issue is a tribute to Dean in the best way that we know how: To contribute to the ongoing vibrancy of the association that he (re)built for all of us. Our hope is that that this collection serves to assist the PSA-and other regional professional associations-to think strategically about their goals and how to achieve them. And, in the process, we hope that it prompts us to consider more deeply the broader goals of our discipline."

    "text": "This book would have never been written without cooperation, encouragement, and advice from our friends and colleagues. They are our co-authors. We would like to give special thanks to Dr. Frank-Yurgen Richter, president of the Geneva-based Horasis consultancy and one of the opinion leaders on today's Asia, for actively supporting the idea and making many valuable comments. Working on the book required three intensive research sessions at the Singapore campus of INSEAD, one of the world's best business schools, famous for its edge in the area of Asian business and economic studies. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Professor Hellmut Schutte who was our host there. He not only let us in, but also offered a lot of food for thought, generously sharing his innovative ideas, and kindly supplied very important materials and data. Brain-storming discussions with INSEAD's leading scholars Peter Williamson, Michael Witt, and Philippe Lasserre provided precious intellectual inputs. We are also very grateful to people from the INSEAD staff, especially the Tanoto Library team, who made the research work there an unforgettable experience. Outside INSEAD, we had very fruitful discussions with Dr. Chia Lin Sien, a distinguished expert on Asian affairs, who was part of the academic staff of the National University of Singapore for thirty years until 2001 before spending two years at the Waseda and Soka Universities in Japan as a visiting professor, and Mr. Wong Meng Quang, who served as a senior offi cer at Singapore's Economic Development Board in the 60s and early 70s and then as a senior diplomat in Japan and China. Also in Singapore, we had a valuable exchange of views with the researchers at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. Important contributions to the book came from the contacts with many Japanese researchers, business people, politicians, and ministries' staff. We'd especially like to mention Ken'ichi Imai, Senior Fellow Emeritus of Stanford University, and Hisao Kanamori, Adviser of the Japan Center for Economic Research. Special thanks to the colleagues and friends from the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, whose advice and support are always important whether they are near or far: Alexander Dynkin, Vyacheslav Amirov, and Sergei Chugrov. Gratitude and tribute to late Vladlen Martynov and Yakov Pevzner. Finally, thank you, Maxim Tselichtchev, for timely and effi cient technical assistance. xiii"

    "text": "One way to generate a random graph is to preserve the number and properties of individual nodes, but otherwise connect them at random (Albert and Barab\u00e1si, 2002). For each homeostatic network in our dataset, we break the network into individual compartments, then reconnect them as follows. We remove all vesicle edges. We then randomly swap remaining edge targets, allowing only swaps between maturation edges or between creation edges. We reject the swap if: a self edge is lost; a self edge is created; or multiple edges of the same type arise between the same source and target nodes. This procedure preserves all individual node properties: self edges, and the separate indegrees and outdegrees of creation and maturation edges. We generate 1000 randomly shuffled networks for each original network. We find that these shuffled networks have precisely the same distribution of motif frequencies and maturation chain lengths as the original networks (  Figure 3A,  BC) . This supports the idea that a random graph generation approach might capture relevant features of vesicle traffic networks."

In particular at the edges of the bones a wrong distance was computed as weighted mean value of foreground (bone) and background . The main drawback of the laser scanner system is the limited range, which required the data acquisition in a lot of individual data sets, what is very time consuming . This will change in the near future with a further development of the system.

Second, Bell nonlocality is necessary and sufficient for certain tasks  [22] , and likewise nonseparability  [23] . Is there a task (beyond the defining one) for which steerability is similarly useful? Third, do there exist steering analogs of Bell operators and entanglement witnesses? Finally, we note that we expect many applications of the concept of steering in quantum measurement theory and experimental quantum information.

    "text": "Despite our analysis is based on only 3 year's data, the modest declines in PM 2.5 in 2015 were consistent with the decrease of the energy consumption. Hence, the moderate improvement in the air quality may be due to the economic slow-down that China is experiencing since 2014. According to official statistics, production of steel, cast iron, cement, and the amount of thermal power generation in 2015 decreased by 2.3%, 3.5%, 4.9% and 2.8%, respectively, and the nation-wide coal consumption decreased by 3.7% in 2015. As the National Bureau of Statistics of China has not released the energy data of each province, unofficial figures from a coal industrial website (http://www.sxcoal.com) showed that the coal consumption in NCP, Liaoning, YRD, Sichuan-Chongqing, and Guangdong declined by 5.4%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 13.7% and 16.8%, respectively, in 2015. These data would explain part of the PM 2.5 reduction in 2015. It is concerning that when the economy recovers, so would the air pollution. It appears timely for China to take a full evaluation on the effectiveness of the air pollution mitigation approach adopted since 2013 as the level of pollution is still very severe even for the cities with lowest PM 2.5 concentration. Our study suggests an approach that respects regional geographical characteristics is needed."

    "text": "3] ) is a full subcategory of the cluster category of mod kQ and has been studied in  [3, 4, 9, 21] . It does not contain any cluster-tilting objects. Theorem 4.4 applies to the case of a maximal rigid object T in C T . It follows that the module categories over the algebras studied in  [21] , i.e. the endomorphism algebras of maximal rigid objects in C T , can be obtained as localisations of C T . The above example gives rise to the case of a rank two tube, with T a maximal rigid object in C T . We see that, as in  [21,  Thm. 4.9], Hom C T (T, M) can be decomposable even if M is indecomposable. It follows from Theorem 4.4 that the same is true for L S (M )."
